# Bookstore API ðŸ“š
Welcome to the Online Bookstore API, a RESTful API designed for managing an online bookstore. It allows users to manage a catalog of books, shopping carts, and orders, and supports user registration and authentication via JWT. The API also includes role-based access control, enabling different levels of access for users and administrators.
